1. Using UserDefaults for storing Weather object's is not a good pratice. Usually I do not like store custom object's in UserDefaults. A correct solution for that is to use Core Data or SQLite database
2. Using hard code defined strings is not a good pratice. One of the correct way is to define strings in a JSON file, as it allows users to change the application language without changeing the phone default language.
3. The network layer is not finished yet. It needs several improvments, but it satisfies every requirement of our application. I decided go with a third party library for networking as is Alomfire or Moya. I think it is an overkill for this application(and for many othrer applications also). Having your own network layer enables you to debug and test your code more easily. And once you know that it works fine, it can be reused on other projects.
4. Please note that I was trying to make the application to support devices down to iphone 5 with iOS 10, but that is not fully tested, as I was working with a iPhone 11 Pro Max simulator and a iPhone X device.
5. One requirement was to install a pod for gradient background, but I decided not to go with it, as it can be done really easily with few lines of code. Instead, I installed SwiftLint. It's a great library for enforcing Swift styles and conventions.
